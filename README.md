Assignment Summary:

1. Solve the harmonic motion equation using four numerical methods: Euler, Improved Euler, Verlet, and Euler-Cromer
2. Plot and compare the numerical solutions against the analytical solution for the system
3. Investigate the impact of the time step size h on the accuracy of the methods. Use a measure such as the system energy to quantify accuracy
4. Using the best numerical method, plot solutions for various damping cases
5. For the best numerical method, investigate sudden application of an external force and forced oscillations with a sinusoidal external force at frequencies different from the system's natural frequency
6. Investigate resonance by calculating and plotting the amplitude of oscillations as a function of the driving force frequency
7. Ensure Jupyter Notebook is structured like an interactive report, with clear comments, labeled plots, and explanations
